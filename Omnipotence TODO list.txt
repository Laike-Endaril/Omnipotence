Find a new way to ensure my mod is first in the event priority queue...
...actual mod loading order may be difficult due to dependencies of my own and other mods
...enum alterations didn't turn out well, though I learned some interesting hacks

See if I can reliably get an event for pre- and post-gc...
...gc run count change timing = ? (probably post- as I assume the thread detecting it will be locked until the gc is done)
...finalize timing = ?
...notification listener timing = ?

Add cpu usage (thread mxbeans have cpu in addition to memory allocation)
Add timestamp

Find a way to differentiate between mods, not just threads...
...intercept execution of mod specific code and do a before/after comparison?
...maybe I can add listeners for all events, and hack-force my listeners to being the first to execute?

Add lang support; skipping any more of it for now to speed up development
Improve command usage descriptions



Notes:
Incredibly early execution can be accomplished by using a tweaker class (implements ITweaker) and a command line argument pointing to it (--tweakClass TweakerClassName)
