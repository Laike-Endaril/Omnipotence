Notes =======================================================================================================================================

Remember to change the jar filename in AgentTest run config whenever a new jar is built
Vanilla calls endSection() more times than it calls startSection(), so I'm currently filtering out vanilla profiler calls



In the current version (1.12.2.000c), the game runs fine with the mod in the mods folder and the javaagent arg in MultiMC, but...

...on dedicated, it runs...
1. If the mod is in mods, and you don't use javaagent
2. If the mod is *not* in mods, and you use javaagent (still loads as a mod)

...but it doesn't run...
1. If the mod is in mods and you use javaagent (duplicate mod crash)
2. If the mod is *not* in mods and you *don't* use javaagent (does not load mod)



Incredibly early execution can be accomplished by using a tweaker class (implements ITweaker) and a command line argument pointing to it (--tweakClass TweakerClassName)
But earliest execution is still from a runtime agent (premain), and both require java args anyway?



TODO =======================================================================================================================================

Use a SortableTable to organize data
Change post-profiling output commands to allow definition of columns you want to display

Force profiler modes above 0 to only run for 1 tick

Account for other threads (right now servers with heavy off-server-thread garbage will skew results)

Finish output for total and peak
